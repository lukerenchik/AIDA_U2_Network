# AIDA U²-Net Project

A Python package for in-memory image segmentation using the U²-Net model. This package processes images entirely in memory—cropping or warping them based on detected contours—so that its output can be fed directly into downstream components (e.g. a CNN for determining if an image is AI‑generated).

## Features

- **In-Memory Processing:** No disk writes; images are processed and returned as NumPy arrays.
- **U²-Net Based:** Uses the U²-Net model to generate saliency masks.
- **Perspective Transformation:** Applies a perspective warp when a quadrilateral is detected.
- **Fallback Cropping:** Falls back to bounding box cropping if a quadrilateral is not detected.
- **Cloud-Ready API:** Designed to be integrated in cloud services where images are processed and passed directly to subsequent stages.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **PyTorch** and **Torchvision**
- **OpenCV** (`opencv-python`)
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (used in demos/visualizations)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd u2net_segmenter

2. **Install the Required Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Download the U^2 Net Weights:**

    Place your pre-trained U²-Net weights (e.g. u2net.pth) inside the weights/ folder. Ensure the path in config.py matches the location of your weights file

## Usage

```
import cv2
from u2net_segmenter import U2NetSegmenter
```

# Initialize the segmenter.
```
segmenter = U2NetSegmenter()
```

# Load an image (ensure the image is in BGR format as used by OpenCV).
```
image = cv2.imread("path/to/your/image.jpg")
if image is None:
    raise ValueError("Unable to load image.")
```

# Process the image.
```
result = segmenter.process_image(image)
```

# The Segmented Output

'result' is a NumPy array containing the segmented (warped or cropped) image. It can now be passed directly into your downstream CNN.

```
cv2.imshow("Segmented Image", result)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

The code above shows how to import and use the U2NetSegmenter class.
Remember that your `image` variable must be a valid OpenCV image (BGR format).


## Running `demos.py` from the Project Root


When you run a Python script directly (e.g., `python examples/demos.py`), Python sets the
current working directory to `examples/` and will not automatically recognize your `src/` folder as a package.

A simple way to fix this is to run your script as a module from the project root:
```
    python -m examples.demos
```
With that command, Python will treat `examples` as a top-level package and can properly import
from `src`. Inside your `demos.py`, you can then use:
```
    from src import U2NetSegmenter
```
